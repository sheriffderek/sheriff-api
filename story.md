# Storyline

## What's happening:

Well, I'm trying to setup an API. I don't know rails / and I don't know Elixir very well... but I know it more than Rails - and it seems like a good bet / So, I'm following along with an embercasts course. I'm going to build my own thing - (not the library) - to make sure I am getting the concepts. I'm going to make an API for a movie company / since my company (PXL Agency) - is mostly in that space.

So far / I just installed the stuff - and got things in order.

Ryan went over the file structure in a nice way. First dev.exe - which is pretty self explainitory. : )

He changed his port to 3000 / but our PHP servers are all on 3000 - so, I'm going to just leave it at 4000.

I used a shorter name for the app this time / sinse you have to reference it a lot.

Note that mix.exs - is the package.json type of file.

Checking out router / not anything too unexpected.

In the video however / I'm seeing 

LibraryApiWeb - whereas in my project I'm seeing a ProjectName.Web

- so, I'm still concerned that I'm on the wrong versions. My files structure is also different / - for example - I have a /web folder.
